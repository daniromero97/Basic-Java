- In Java you have a class "Hashtable" defined in the package "java.util", which allows you to store objects of any type to which an index of a type is associated.
- An instance of Hashtable has two parameters that affect its performance: initial capacity and load factor.
- The capacity is the number of buckets in the hash table, and the initial capacity is simply the capacity at the time the hash table is created.

- Create a Hashtable (two forms):
    Hashtable ht1 = new Hashtable();
    Hashtable<Integer, String> ht2 = new Hashtable<Integer, String>();

- Most used methods:
    // Add an item to the list in n position
        ht1.put(n, a);

    // Get the element associated with the key (5)
        ht1.get(5);

    // Delete the element associated with the key (5)
        ht1.remove(5);

    // Delete all the elements
        ht1.clear();

    // Replace the element with another
        ht1.replace(1, a);

    // Get de size of the Hashtable
        ht1.size();

    // Check if the Hashtable is empty
        ht1.isEmpty();

    // Make a copy
        ht1.clone();

    // Indicates if the object is in the list
        ht1.contains(a);

    // Indicates if the key is in the list
        ht1.containsKey(5);

    // Convert the hashtable to an enumeration object
        Enumeration<String> elements = ht1.elements();
        Enumeration<Integer> keys = ht1.keys();
