- Syntactically, the "if" instruction is defined as follows:
    if(expression) instruction;
    * If the result of "expression" is true, then the only instruction is executed.

     if (expresion)
     {
          instruction1;
          ...
          InstructionN;
     }
     * If the result of "expression" is true, then each of the instructions enclosed in braces is executed.


- An example of an "if" statement would be the following:
    s = "odd"
    if (a% 2 == 0)
    {
        s = "even";
    }
    System.out.println (s);

    * In the "if" statement, it is checked if "a" is even. If so, the text "even" is stored in the string "s".
    * In the previous example, initially "a" is odd.
