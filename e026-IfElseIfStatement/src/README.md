- Syntactically, the "if else if" instruction is defined as follows:
    ```
    if(expresion1) {
        instruccion11;
        …
        instruccion1N;
    }
    else if (expresion2)
    {
       instruccion21;
        …
        instruccion2N;
    }
    …
    else
    {
       instruccionE1;
        …
        instruccionEN;
    }
    ```
- The expressions "expression1", "expression2", etc., are evaluated in succession.
- The first one that is true, all the instructions enclosed in currencies that follow the expression are executed.
- And if all the expressions are false, all the instructions that are enclosed in braces are executed after "else".
- You can remove the keys to continuation of each condition if there is only one instruction to execute following these conditions.
