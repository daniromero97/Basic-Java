- The conditional operator (? :) is a ternary operator (it takes three operands).
- The conditional operator works as follows:
    * The first operand is implicitly converted to bool. It is evaluated and all side effects are completed before continuing.
    * If the first operand evaluates to true (1), the second operand is evaluated.
    * If the first operand evaluates to false (0), the third operand is evaluated.

- expression ? expression : expression
- Example:

    a = (a>0)? 1 : b+2;      // if true, a=1, else, a=b+2
    -------- equals --------
    if(a>0) a = 1;
    else a = b+2;
