- Regular expressions are strings that represent patterns.
- With regular expressions you can check whether a string has a certain format or not.
- For example, you can verify if a string has a numeric format, is a phone number, is a DNI, is a word, etc.

- To verify that a certain string "s" meets a regular expression, the following expression is used:
    * a.matches("Regular expression")   // Boolean

- In the case that a certain string has a numeric format (byte, short, int, long, float, doubl√©), it can be converted to that type with the following methods:
    * Byte.valueOf(string);
    * Short.valueOf(string);
    * Integer.valueOf(string);
    * Long.valueOf(string);
    * Float.valueOf(string);
    * Double.valueOf(string);
