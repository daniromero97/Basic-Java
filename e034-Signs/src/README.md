- The signals are global or local variables that store a value that indicates whether a process has taken place or not.
- They are variables that usually take values of true or false.

- Example:
    * Make a program that reads 5 numbers and get the sum of the first 3 odd.
    * If there were no 3 odd, the result would be 0.
