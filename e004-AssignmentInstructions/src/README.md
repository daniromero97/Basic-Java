- The assignment statement allows you to modify the values â€‹â€‹of the variables.
    - For example, we have the following variables:
    ```
    int a = 2;
    int b = 5;
    float c = 0;
    char d = 'a';
    ```
    
- You can modify the value of the variable "a" by assigning it the value of the variable "b" with the following assignment instruction:
    ```
    a = b; // now "a" has the value 5
    ```
    
- You can also modify the value of the variable "b" by assigning a literal or constant of type integer:
    ```
    b = 2;
    ```
    
- Other examples of valid assignments would be the following:
    ```
    byte m= 127;
    double v = 5.1;
    short w = -34;
    v = w;      // double > short
    w = m;      // short > byte
    ```
