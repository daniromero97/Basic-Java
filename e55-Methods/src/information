- The methods are a group of instructions (body of the method) that have a name (method name), an input (method parameters) and, optionally, an output (method return).
- Such methods can access global variables and are defined within a class.

- Example:

        int sum (int a, int b)
        {
            return a+b;
        }

        The above method is called "sum", it has two parameters ("(int a, int b)") and returns an integer ("int").
        In the body of the method, the sum of the parameters would be returned.


- In a class you can define several methods with the same name that vary by the number of parameters or by the type of these parameters. This is called method overloading.



- RETURN STATEMENT:
    * The "return" instruction is used to terminate the execution of a method by passing a value ("return expression" ") or nothing (" return; ").
    * This last statement can only be used when the method returns nothing, as is the case with the "init" method.
